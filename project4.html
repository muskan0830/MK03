									<p>Ah, Netflix and YouTube, the two titans of our screen time. They're like the sun and moon of the entertainment universe, ruling our nights and days with their endless streams of videos.</p>
									<p>Imagine a cozy armchair, a warm blanket, and a bottomless pit of shows and movies. That's Netflix. It's the land of curated content, where algorithms know your deepest desires before you even do. Want a tearjerker rom-com? Boom, it's there. Craving a documentary about competitive yodeling? Netflix has got you covered (seriously, there's one).</p>
									<p>Now picture a bustling street market, overflowing with sights, sounds, and everything in between. That's YouTube. It's the wild west of videos, where cat videos rub shoulders with educational lectures and conspiracy theories about the Illuminati (don't judge, we've all been down that rabbit hole). You can learn how to knit a scarf, fix a leaky faucet, and literally anything.</p>
									<p>But do you ever wonder who reigns supreme? </p>
									<p>These two titans of streaming have carved their own paths to our eyeballs, offering entertainment, education, and even ways to earn a living. But which one is king (or queen) of the content castle?</p>
									
									<h4 class="major">But how this fits in your puzzle?</h4>
									<p>The epic battle between Netflix and YouTube! Turns out, your business is facing similar showdowns every day!
										Just like I cracked the code on who reigns supreme in the streaming, I can help you decode the mysteries hidden within your own data. This is how I can help you!</p>
									<ul>
										<li><h4>Spot the gold:</h4>I'll show you where the untapped opportunities are hiding in your data, so you can grab them before your competitors do.</li>
										<li><h4>Dodge the traps:</h4>I'll help you identify potential threats early on, so you can steer clear of trouble and keep your business safe.</li>
										<li><h4>Make sense of the numbers:</h4>No more confusing charts and graphs! I'll turn your data into easy-to-understand pictures that even your goldfish can understand (metaphorically speaking, of course!).</li>
										<li><h4>Tell a winning story:</h4>Don't worry if you speak fluent "mumbo jumbo" and your team speaks "marketing jargon." I'll be your trusty translator, turning complex findings into clear, compelling stories that everyone can understand.</li>
									</ul>
									
									<h3 class="major"></h3>
									<h2>Let's continue this journey!</h2>	
									<p></p>	

									<h3 class="major">Objective</h3>
									<p>My mission: uncover the revenue streams, user bases, and hidden trends of these streaming giants. I began my data-driven journey using Tableau to answer the burning questions:
										<ul>
										   <li>Who rakes in more cash?</li>
										   <li>Is everyone on YouTube or Netflix?</li>
										   <li>What's the deal with YouTube Premium's meteoric rise?</li>
										   <li>Is Netflix losing ground, or just taking a dramatic detour?</li></ul>
									</p>
									<p>Buckle up, folks, because the results are surprising!</p>

									<h3 class="major">Round 1: Revenue Showdown!</h3>
									<p>Netflix may be the heavyweight with $165 billion in total revenue, but YouTube punches back with its massive user base and ad dollars, bringing in a respectable $135 billion. It's like Netflix is the luxurious restaurant with a limited clientele, while YouTube is the bustling street food stall for the masses</p>

									<h3 class="major">Round 2: User Uprising</h3>
									<p>YouTube takes the user crown by a landslide (Need numbers? Itâ€™s 18 billion!!). More people are jamming to cat videos and learning DIY hacks than settling in for a Netflix marathon (Merely 1 Billion!). It's like everyone has a YouTube account, while Netflix subscriptions are still a special treat.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Round 3: Premium Powerhouse</h3>
									<p>Remember when everyone laughed at YouTube Premium? Not anymore! Those subscribers shot from 1 million in 2015 to a whopping 80 million in 2022! Talk about a glow-up! This shows that people are willing to pay for ad-free streaming and exclusive content.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Round 4: Geography Games</h3>
									<p>Turns out, Netflix's biggest fans live in the USA and Canada. Those two countries together are like Netflix's personal ATM. Think red carpets, maple syrup, and endless binge-watching</p>

									<h3 class="major">Round 5: The loss Rollercoaster</h3>
									<p>Hold onto your popcorn! Netflix's annual losses took a wild ride between 2018 and 2021, with ups and downs as dramatic as any cliffhanger in "Stranger Things." This just proves that even the streaming giants have to navigate their own challenges</p>

									<h3 class="major">Conclusion</h3>
									<p>So, who wins the crown? Well, that's like asking who wins, pizza or tacos? They're both delicious, just in different ways. Netflix is your reliable best friend, always there with a comforting shoulder (or binge-worthy show) when you need it. YouTube is the crazy, unpredictable cousin who introduces you to new and bizarre things you never knew existed. Both YouTube and Netflix rule different parts of the streaming kingdom. One for the masses, one for the discerning, both leaving us entertained, informed, and maybe even a little addicted. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, and both are constantly evolving.</p>
									<p>Ultimately, the winner is... you! You get to choose your own adventure, whether it's a carefully curated Netflix marathon or a wild YouTube rabbit hole expedition
									</p>

									<h3 class="major"></h3>
									<p>This project was my data-driven adventure into the world of streaming. I used skills like:
										<ul>
										   <li>Data analysis: I wrangled and analyzed data from various sources.</li>
										   <li>Visualization: I turned those numbers into colorful graphs and charts that anyone could understand, even if they can't tell the difference between a bar graph and a pie chart.</li>
										   <li>Storytelling: I made the data come alive with insights and humor, because who wants to read a boring data dump?</li></ul>
