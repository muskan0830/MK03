									<p>In today's ever-changing workplace, it's super important for companies to really know what's going on with their employees. That's where the HR Dashboard comes in – it's like a treasure hunt into the details of who's working, why some folks leave, and how everyone's feeling.</p>

									<p>Think of it as a special tool to help businesses handle tricky stuff like keeping talented people around, making sure there's a good mix of different folks, and looking out for everyone's well-being. Imagine having a magic lens that turns piles of numbers into super useful insights.</p>
									
									<p>This project is like a guidebook for leaders and HR folks, showing them the ropes of what makes their team tick. It's not just about the stats; it's about understanding the heartbeat of the workplace. By using this data, organizations can make smart decisions to create a workplace where everyone – from the company to the employees – can do their best. </p>

									<h3 class="major">Objective</h3>
									<p>The objective of this project was to create a comprehensive HR dashboard in Power BI, providing valuable insights into employee demographics, turnover analysis, and wellness within the organization. The dashboards aim to empower decision-makers with actionable information for effective workforce management, retention strategies, and overall employee well-being.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Chapter 1: Data Preprocessing</h3>
									<p>Before diving into the dashboards, meticulous data preprocessing was conducted. Redundant columns were removed, null values were addressed, and duplicates were eliminated. Additionally, columns were appropriately renamed in the Power Query Editor of Power BI, ensuring a clean and organized dataset for insightful visualizations.</p>

                                    <h3 class="major">Chapter 2: Overview Dashboard</h3>
