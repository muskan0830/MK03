									<p>Remember those enchanting Saturday nights, huddled with siblings, bewitched by the cinematic wonders of Harry, Hermione, and Ron? The Harry Potter movies were more than just films; they were the cornerstone of our childhood, weaving a tapestry of friendship, courage, and magic.  From the moment Hagrid uttered those unforgettable words, "You're a wizard, Harry," we were hooked. From the bustling corridors of Hogwarts to the enchanting forbidden forest, the movies were a visual feast. </p>

									<h4>But how this fits in your puzzle?</h4>
									<p>Businesses crave stories behind their customers, and that's where I come in! Imagine this:
										<ul>
										<li>Want to know how customers *really* feel about your product? I can scrape reviews, analyze the emotions, and aha! You've got a magic potion of insights to improve it.</li>
										<li>Lost in a sea of social media comments? No worries! I can untangle the mess and reveal what people are *truly* saying.</li>
										<li>Stuck in a marketing rut? Fear not! I can decode the most powerful words that resonate with your audience, casting spells of attraction and boosting your brand.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>

									<h3 class="major"></h3>
									<h2>Let's continue this journey!</h2>
									<p></p>	

									<h3 class="major">Objective</h3>
									<p>My goal was to unravel the mysteries of Professor Snape from the Harry Potter series using web scraping and sentiment analysis techniques. Through this magical coding adventure, I aimed to understand Snape's emotional landscape and uncover the most enchanted words that defined his story.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Chapter 1: The Sorcery of Web Scraping</h3>
									<p>I employed the art of web scraping to gather Snape's story from a special webpage. Picture it like sending a coded owl to fetch a letter, but instead, we fetched paragraphs filled with Snape's tales. Using magical tools like BeautifulSoup and NLTK, I transformed these paragraphs into a neat scroll, saved in a CSV file.</p>

                                    <h3 class="major">Chapter 2: The Potion for Sentiment Analysis</h3>
									<p>This is where the real magic happens! I delved into Snape's sentiments using the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer potion. By assigning magical labels like 'angry' or 'protective,' I unveiled the emotions that weave through Snape's narrative. The results painted a captivating picture—Snape's worries took the lead, followed by contempt, anger, and a strong sense of protectiveness.</p>
                                    
									<h3 class="major">Chapter 3: Discovering the Most Magical Words</h3>
									<p>Summoning the top words echoing in digital Hogwarts, I created a playlist of wizarding hits: Snape, Harry, Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Lily. It's like decoding Snape's favorite spells. Filtering mundane words and lemmatizing for simplicity, I uncovered the essence of Snape's story.</p>
                                    
									<h3 class="major">Key Insights: </h3>
									<h4>Snape's Emotional Landscape</h4>
                                    <p>The sentiment analysis potion unveiled the layers of Snape's emotions. From the depths of worry to the heights of
                                     protectiveness, Snape's sentiments paint a portrait of a character as complex as the enchanted dungeons of
                                     Hogwarts.</p>

                                    <ul>
                                     <li>Worry takes the lead with 22.51%, reflecting Snape's perpetual concern in the wizarding saga.</li>
                                     <li>Contempt and anger follow closely at 19.32% and 14.94%, capturing Snape's moments of disdain and frustration.
                                     </li>
                                     <li>Protectiveness stands tall at 10.06%, showcasing the guardian within Snape.</li>
                                      <li>Sarcasm, sacrifice, ambiguity, and affection weave through his narrative, each adding a unique hue to the canvas
                                       of his emotions.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <ul>
									  <li>The word 'Snape' appears 703 times. As expected, the enigmatic Potions Master is at the center of his own tale.</li>

									<h3 class="major">Conclusion: </h3>
